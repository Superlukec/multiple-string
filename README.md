multiple-string
===============

Multiple string from input collector with JSON generator.

I don't know what is the right name for this. But I saw it on few of social medias, where
you want to send message to multiple users.

In this project I used:

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com//)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
- [JSON-js](http://lukasemolic.si/frendly/)

Demo can be found [here](http://lukasemolic.si/multiple-string/).
